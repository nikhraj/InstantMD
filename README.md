## Problem Statement
### Abstract
Being able to have machines understand unstructured textual content already plays a big part nowadays in our life. NLP can contribute largely to the advancement of medical science. NLP is used to extract information from free text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers. Here we approach natural language processing algorithm where we
