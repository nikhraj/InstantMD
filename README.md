## Problem Statement
### Abstract
Being able to have machines understand unstructured textual content already plays a big part nowadays in our life. NLP can contribute largely to the advancement of medical science. NLP is used to extract information from free text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers. Here we approach natural language processing algorithm where we

* Evaluate the free text and compare it with the dataset of NLP Dictionary.
* Annotated the important textual content from the text like Medication, Investigation (Pathology, Radiology), Chief Complaint.
* After Segregation the highlighted data should automatically enter the flow of EMR.

### Problem Definition
To develop a solution, the first step is to understand the problem. Develop an NLP module to identify the keywords related to a patient's investigation, medication and chief complaint from a free text in the text box. Highlight the extracted content and feed them as input in EMRâ€™s Chief complaint, Investigation and Medication module.
